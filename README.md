[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kevinludwig/chess-opening-insights.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kevinludwig/chess-opening-insights)

Analyze a PGN file to determine which openings I perform poorly in. E.g. where should I focus my opening study? Generally it's
not much different than the lichess opening insight showing performance by ECO code. I'm planning on adding additional insights 
that I can't get out of lichess.

### Usage

./insight.js my-games.pgn
```

### Output

```

### Run tests

npm test
